# Memory — #PROJECT_OVERHAUL

## Who You're Working With
**Mikey** (Michael Scholl) — Family medicine physician and residency program director. Self-taught data architect. Speaks in concepts and biological analogies. Strong architectural instincts — his design calls are almost always better than first proposals. Has API access (key in env vars). Runs long-running code himself (copy-paste-run pattern).

## The Project in One Sentence
ABFM ITE Intelligence System — a queryable Family Medicine board exam knowledge base (1,629 questions, 2018–2025) linked to a clinical guideline library (1,936 articles, 404 PDFs) via a structured SQLite pipeline.

## Terms — Decode These First

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **ITE** | In-Training Examination (ABFM Family Medicine board exam) |
| **ABFM** | American Board of Family Medicine |
| **VC** | AAFP Board Prep Video Course (48 sessions, the priority filter) |
| **VC gate** | `key_data_files/session_hy_inserts_v7.json` — 352 citations — SOLE criterion for right_click tier |
| **BATON** | Session handoff document. Read the active one first, every session |
| **codon** | Filename format: `Author_Year#@#ART-XXXX@#@.pdf` — start `#@#`, stop `@#@` |
| **ART-ID** | Article primary key (e.g. ART-1234) — embedded in codon filename |
| **QID** | Question ID format: `QID-YYYY-NNNN` (e.g. QID-2024-0042) |
| **right_click / $right_click$** | M2 completed tier: VC_pass + fully enriched (DOCX exists) |
| **local_lite** | M2 completed tier: VC_fail + fully enriched (DOCX exists) |
| **VC_pass** | M1 staging tier: passed VC gate, awaiting full pipeline (`VC_pass/` folder, was `02_codon/`) |
| **VC_fail** | M1 staging tier: failed VC gate, awaiting full pipeline (`VC_fail/` folder, was `00_non-codon/`) |
| **HY inserts** | High-Yield inserts — the enrichment content injected into the VC outline |
| **enricher** | `ite_intelligence_enricher.py` — primary v4 enricher, Strategy 0 = codon parse |
| **Strategy 0** | Regex parse of codon to extract ART-ID — primary match strategy, always first |
| **the DB** | `00_database/db/ite_intelligence.db` — source of truth, never disposable |
| **PROJECT_ROOT** | 2 levels up from SCRIPT_DIR — `SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent; PROJECT_ROOT = SCRIPT_DIR.parent.parent` (= 3 hops from file) |
| **M1 / M2 / M3 / M4** | Warehouse / Processor / Analyst / Sandbox modules |
| **Module F** | VC Outline Pipeline: 01→02b→03→04→07→08→09→build_v6 |
| **keyword pipeline** | A→B→C→D→E_v4→F→G scripts |
| **Intelligence 2.0** | Layer 1 (ICD-10), Layer 2 (PubMed currency), Layer 3 (Pathways), Layer 4 (Trends) |
| **FLAG 33** | nnn_XXXX ART-ID rename scheme — designed, not yet implemented |
| **derived data** | Disposable: JSONs, DOCXs, CSVs. DB + PDFs + VC gate are protected source data |
| **_index.md** | Ground-truth directory map — `00_#PROJECT_OVERHAUL/_index.md` |
| **TODO: not yet migrated** | Code annotation — path points to correct future location; update when file arrives |

## Module Map

| Module | Path | What it does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| M1 Warehouse | `01_module.1_warehouse/` | PDF library (4 tiers) + build/ + maintain/ scripts |
| M2 Processor | `02_module.2_processor/` | Extraction, enrichment, DOCX builders + source/ inputs |
| M3 Analyst | `03_module.3_analyst/` | ICD-10 tagging, pathways, trends, score analysis |
| M4 Sandbox | `04_module.4_sandbox/` | Experiments, agents |
| DB | `00_database/db/ite_intelligence.db` | Source of truth |
| VC Gate | `key_data_files/session_hy_inserts_v7.json` | 352 citations |

## Locked Rules (never override without Mikey confirming)

1. **Fix the data, not the code.** If a script gets complex to handle messy data → clean the data upstream instead.
2. **VC gate = sole criterion** for right_click tier. DB membership alone is not sufficient.
3. **Source data is protected.** DB + PDFs + VC gate survive everything. Derived files are disposable.
4. **Dynamic paths only.** Python: `SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent; PROJECT_ROOT = SCRIPT_DIR.parent.parent`. JS: `path.resolve(__dirname, "../../")`.
5. **No de novo JS.** Existing JS scripts migrate fine. New code = Python only.
6. **BATON first.** Read the active BATON before any work. It has deferred flags and current state.
7. **QC after every integration.** Schema-level column-by-column population comparison, old cohort vs new.
8. **Git from Windows.** VM can stage/commit but cannot `rm` NTFS files. Deletions happen from Windows.
9. **Strategy 0 in every enricher.** Codon parse is always the first matching strategy.
10. **Schemas before scripts.** SQL `CREATE TABLE` defined before build scripts are written.

## Next Steps (as of BATON 012, 2026-03-26)
1. **NULL out 4 data_corrupt rows** — question_ref_pairs rows with question stem text (QID-2024-0133, QID-2025-0029, QID-2025-0079, QID-2025-0138)
2. **Investigate 179 well_formed NULL clean_ref rows** — likely new 2024-2025 articles not yet in DB; verify and plan ingestion pass
3. **ART-0864 title fix** — title stored as "e45-e67"; fix to Metlay/Waterer 2019 CAP guideline
4. **54 no-art-id flat JSONs** — title-match pass to link to DB
5. **E2E module tests** — M1 `build_crosswalk_index.py`, M3 `build_icd10_tags.py` report
6. **Intelligence 2.0 Layer 2** — `article_currency` table via PubMed MCP
